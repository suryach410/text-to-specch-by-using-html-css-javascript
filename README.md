# text-to-specch-by-using-html-css-javascript
This project converts written text into spoken words using the Web Speech API. The interface is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Users can type or paste any text. All files are linked externally — index.html (UI), styles.css (design), and script.js (speech logic).
